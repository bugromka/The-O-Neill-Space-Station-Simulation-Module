A NOTE ON FEATURE-SPECIFIC CLAUSES: This license is broad in scope and
references many possible application features (such as biometrics,
messaging, in-app purchases, push notifications, location services,
and more). Where a clause refers to a feature the Software does not
actually provide, that clause is inoperative for the deployment in
question and does not need to be modified or removed; it simply does
not apply.

================================================================================

The following uses are explicitly and STRICTLY prohibited. Every clause
in this Section 4 is to be read as a strict prohibition; the word

under Section 3 is implicitly prohibited regardless of whether it
appears in this section.

The prohibitions in this section are stated explicitly for the avoidance
of doubt and to provide specific legal enforceability. Their explicit
enumeration does not limit the scope of the general prohibition above,
nor does it imply that any use not listed here is permitted.

      individual basis. Neither party may bring or participate in any
      class action, collective action, mass action, or representative
      proceeding arising under this license. Where mandatory consumer-
      protection, civil-procedure, or other law (including but not
      limited to applicable laws of the European Union, the United
      Kingdom, Australia, Canada, Brazil, India, Japan, South Africa,
      certain U.S. states, and other jurisdictions worldwide)
      prohibits, restricts, or limits class-action waivers, this
      clause shall apply only to the maximum extent permitted by such
      law, and shall not deprive any natural-person consumer of any
      non-waivable statutory right of collective redress.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.7 WAIVER
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.7.1 No failure or delay by the Author in exercising any right, power,
      or remedy under this license shall operate as a waiver of that
      right, power, or remedy.

6.7.2 No single or partial exercise of any right shall preclude any
      other or further exercise of that right or the exercise of any
      other right.

6.7.3 Any waiver by the Author must be in writing and signed by the
      Author to be effective. No verbal agreement, informal
      communication, or course of conduct shall constitute a waiver of
      any provision of this license.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.8 ENTIRE AGREEMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.8.1 This license constitutes the entire agreement between the Author
      and any Licensee with respect to the Software and supersedes all
      prior or contemporaneous understandings, agreements,
      representations, and communications, whether written or oral,
      relating to its subject matter.

6.8.2 No comment, issue thread, forum post, social-media post, chat
      message, direct message, verbal statement, or other informal
      communication by the Author or any representative — on any
      platform — shall modify, override, or supplement any term of
      this license. The sole permitted method of modifying this
      license is a formal amendment published in accordance with
      clause 6.10, which is expressly recognized as an exception to
      this clause 6.8.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.10 AMENDMENTS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.10.1 The Author reserves the right to amend, update, or replace this
       license at any time by publishing a new version in the official
       Repository.

6.10.2 For non-material changes (such as typographical corrections,
       clarifications that do not reduce Licensee rights, or formatting
       updates), continued access to, use of, or interaction with the
       Software following publication of the amended license constitutes
       acceptance of the amended terms.

6.10.3 For MATERIAL changes (changes that meaningfully expand Licensee
       obligations, reduce Licensee rights, alter dispute-resolution
       provisions, or change the IP-assignment terms in Section 5):
       (a) the Author shall use Reasonable Efforts to provide notice
       via (i) the official Repository, (ii) any other primary
       communication channel the Author maintains, and (iii) where
       email contact information has been provided by the
       Licensee, direct email notification;
       (b) the amended terms take effect no earlier than thirty (30)
       calendar days after publication;
       (c) continued use after that effective date constitutes
       acceptance only if the Licensee has been given a reasonable
       opportunity to review the changes;
       (d) any Licensee who does not accept the material changes may
       terminate their use of the Software under the prior version
       by ceasing all use within the 30-day notice window, with no
       penalty other than the obligations that survive termination
       under Section 6.4; and
       (e) the Author shall make prior versions of this license
       accessible (e.g., via Repository history or an archive
       page) for so long as any Licensee or Contributor relies on
       them.

6.10.4 Contributions accepted under a prior version of this license
       remain subject to the intellectual property assignment and patent
       non-assertion obligations of that prior version.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.11 FORCE MAJEURE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.11.1 The Author shall not be liable for any failure or delay in
       performing obligations under this license caused by circumstances
       beyond the Author's reasonable control, including but not limited
       to acts of God, war, armed conflict, terrorism, pandemic, natural
       disaster, governmental action, sanctions, cyberattack, or
       widespread infrastructure failure.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.12 CHILDREN'S DATA PROTECTION (COPPA COMPLIANCE)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.12.1 AGE REQUIREMENT
       This Software is intended for use by persons aged eighteen (18)
       and above. No person under the age of 18 is permitted to use,
       access, or interact with this Software or its associated
       services.

6.12.2 PROHIBITION ON CHILDREN'S DATA
       Because access by minors is not permitted, no Licensee should
       be processing personal data of any minor through this Software.
       For the avoidance of doubt, and in compliance with the Children's
       Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), the EU General Data
       Protection Regulation (Article 8), the UK Age Appropriate Design
       Code, and equivalent applicable regulations worldwide:
       (a) no Licensee, Contributor, or authorized user shall knowingly
       collect, process, store, or transmit personal data of any
       individual under the age of 18 in connection with this
       Software;
       (b) any inadvertent collection of personal data of individuals
       under the age of 13 (or such higher age as may apply under
       local law) constitutes a Material Breach of this license.

6.12.3 DISCOVERY OF MINOR'S DATA
       Any Contributor or Licensee who discovers or reasonably suspects
       the presence of data belonging to a minor must immediately
       notify the Author and cease all processing of such data pending
       the Author's instructions.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.13 ASSIGNMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.13.1 The Author may assign, transfer, or delegate any or all rights
       and obligations under this license to any successor, acquirer,
       or Affiliate. Where reasonably practicable, the Author shall
       publish notice of such assignment in the Repository. Any
       assignee must agree to be bound by the Author's obligations
       under this license, and must not unilaterally impose materially
       more burdensome terms on existing Licensees without complying
       with the amendment procedure in clause 6.10.3.

6.13.2 Licensees may not assign, transfer, sublicense, or delegate any
       rights or obligations under this license to any third party
       without the Author's prior written consent. Any attempted
       assignment in violation of this clause is void. This clause
       does not prohibit transfer by operation of law (e.g., on death
       or corporate succession), provided the transferee is bound by
       this license going forward.

6.13.3 If the Author dies, dissolves, becomes insolvent, or otherwise
       ceases to exist without an identified successor, the Author's
       rights and obligations under this license shall pass to the
       Author's legal heirs, executor, liquidator, or other statutory
       successor as determined by applicable law.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.14 INDEMNIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.14.1 You agree to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless the Author
       from and against any and all claims, damages, losses,
       liabilities, costs, and expenses (including reasonable
       attorneys' fees, arbitration costs, and expert-witness fees)
       arising out of or in connection with:
       (a) your Material Breach of this license;
       (b) your use of the Software in violation of applicable law;
       (c) your negligence, willful misconduct, or fraudulent activity
       in connection with the Software;
       (d) any Contribution you submit that infringes the intellectual
       property rights of any third party;
       (e) any third-party claim arising from your unauthorized use,
       modification, distribution, or deployment of the Software.
       Your indemnification obligations under this clause are
       proportional to your degree of fault and shall not extend to
       claims caused by the Author's own gross negligence, willful
       misconduct, or fraud.

6.14.2 The Author shall provide prompt written notice of any claim
       subject to indemnification under this section, provided that
       failure to provide such notice shall not relieve You of your
       indemnification obligations except to the extent You are
       materially prejudiced by such failure.

6.14.3 The indemnifying party shall have the right to assume control of
       the defense of any indemnified claim at its own expense. The
       indemnified party shall cooperate reasonably in such defense.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.15 CONFIDENTIALITY
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.15.1 By accessing the Software's source code, You acknowledge that
       You may gain access to Confidential Information as defined in
       Section 1.

6.15.2 You agree to:
       (a) treat all Confidential Information with at least the same
       degree of care You use to protect your own confidential
       information, but in no event less than reasonable care;
       (b) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party
       without the Author's prior written consent;
       (c) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than
       exercising the Permitted Uses explicitly authorized under
       Section 3 of this license;
       (d) limit access to Confidential Information to individuals who
       have a legitimate need to access it for Permitted Uses and
       who are bound by obligations of confidentiality no less
       protective than those in this clause.

6.15.3 The confidentiality obligations in this clause do not apply to
       information that:
       (a) is or becomes publicly available through no fault of the
       Licensee;
       (b) was already known to the Licensee prior to accessing this
       Software without any obligation of confidentiality;
       (c) is independently developed by the Licensee without reference
       to the Confidential Information;
       (d) is required to be disclosed by law, regulation, or court
       order, provided the Licensee gives the Author prompt written
       notice (where legally permissible) and cooperates with the
       Author's efforts to obtain protective treatment.

6.15.4 The confidentiality obligations in this section shall survive
       termination of this license for a period of five (5) years from
       the date of termination, or, with respect only to information
       that continues to qualify as a trade secret under applicable
       law and that has not become publicly available through no
       fault of the Licensee, for so long as it continues so to
       qualify, whichever is longer. The Licensee's obligations under
       this clause are subject to the exceptions in clause 6.15.3.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.16 DATA BREACH NOTIFICATION
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.16.1 Any Licensee, Contributor, or authorized entity who discovers or
       reasonably suspects a data breach, security incident, or
       unauthorized access to user data in connection with this Software
       shall notify the Author within forty-eight (48) hours of discovery.

6.16.2 The notification must include, to the extent known at the time:
       (a) the nature and scope of the breach or suspected breach;
       (b) the categories and approximate number of data subjects
       affected;
       (c) the categories and approximate volume of data records
       affected;
       (d) the likely consequences of the breach;
       (e) the measures taken or proposed to address and mitigate the
       breach.

6.16.3 The notifying party shall cooperate fully with the Author's
       investigation and remediation efforts, including preserving
       evidence, providing access logs, and assisting with regulatory
       notifications as required by applicable law.

6.16.4 Failure to comply with the notification obligations in this
       section constitutes a Material Breach of this license and shall
       result in immediate termination under clause 6.3.1, in addition
       to any other remedies available to the Author.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.17 STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.17.1 Any claim or cause of action arising out of or in connection with
       this license or the Software must be commenced within five (5)
       years from the date the claimant knew or reasonably should have
       known of the facts giving rise to the claim.

6.17.2 This limitation period applies to all claims regardless of legal
       theory, including but not limited to breach of contract, tort,
       intellectual property infringement, and statutory violations.

6.17.3 This clause does not override any mandatory statute of limitations
       under applicable law that cannot be shortened by agreement. In
       such cases, the longer mandatory period shall apply.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.18 ENTERPRISE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.18.1 Any entity entering into a separate written commercial agreement
       with the Author (whether pursuant to clauses 4.1.5, 4.3.1, 4.3.2,
       or any other provision authorizing commercial use) must maintain,
       at its own expense, adequate cyber-liability insurance coverage
       for the duration of such agreement.

6.18.2 The minimum coverage shall be no less than one million US dollars
       (USD $1,000,000) per occurrence for the baseline tier of
       commercial use, or such higher or (in the case of small-scale
       commercial use) lower amount as the Author and the Licensee may
       agree in the underlying commercial agreement based on the scope,
       risk profile, and nature of the authorized use.

6.18.3 Upon request, the authorized entity shall provide the Author with
       certificates of insurance demonstrating compliance with this
       clause within fourteen (14) calendar days.

6.18.4 Failure to maintain the required insurance coverage constitutes a
       material breach of the underlying commercial agreement and may
       result in immediate termination of the commercial license,
       without prejudice to the surviving obligations under Section 6.4.

6.18.5 REVOCATION OF COMMERCIAL LICENSE. The Author may revoke any
       commercial license granted under a separate written commercial
       agreement (a) for any Material Breach of this license or of
       that agreement, (b) for failure to maintain required insurance
       under clause 6.18, (c) for failure to pay any fees due under
       the commercial agreement after thirty (30) days' written notice
       to cure, or (d) on any other ground expressly set out in the
       commercial agreement. Revocation is in addition to, and not in
       lieu of, the termination remedies in Section 6.3.

────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
6.19 ACCESSIBILITY COMPLIANCE
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

6.19.1 The Author commits to using reasonable efforts to maintain
       compliance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)
       2.2 Level AA standards (or any successor version published by
       the W3C), or equivalent accessibility standards as applicable
       in relevant jurisdictions (including, where applicable, EN 301
       549 in the EU and Section 508 in the United States).

6.19.2 Accessibility deficiencies reported through official channels will
       be treated with the same priority as security vulnerabilities and
       addressed in a timely manner.

6.19.3 Nothing in this clause creates a guarantee of full accessibility
       compliance at all times. The Author's obligation is one of
       reasonable effort, not absolute result.

================================================================================
                        SECTION 9 — GENERAL PROVISIONS
================================================================================

9.1 HEADINGS
    Section headings and clause titles in this license are for
    convenience only and shall not affect the interpretation of any
    provision.

9.2 LANGUAGE
    This license is written in English, which is the authoritative
    and controlling version. In the event of any conflict between
    this English version and any translation, the English version
    shall prevail, except to the extent that mandatory local law
    (such as the Loi Toubon in France, the Charter of the French
    Language in Quebec, or equivalent language-requirement laws in
    other jurisdictions) requires that a local-language version
    control, in which case the local-language version shall control
    only to the minimum extent required by such mandatory law.

9.3 NO PARTNERSHIP OR AGENCY
    Nothing in this license shall be construed to create a partnership,
    joint venture, employment relationship, or agency between the
    Author and any Licensee or Contributor.

9.4 THIRD-PARTY RIGHTS
    This license does not create any rights enforceable by third
    parties except as explicitly stated herein.

9.5 TRADEMARK NOTICE
    All Trademarks (including all service marks, trade names, logos,
    trade dress, and branding) associated with this Software are the
    exclusive property of [AUTHOR_LEGAL_NAME]. Nothing in this license
    grants any right to use any Trademark of the Author except as
    expressly permitted under clause 3.9.10.

9.6 CUMULATIVE REMEDIES
    All rights and remedies available to the Author under this license
    are cumulative and in addition to any other rights and remedies
    available at law, in equity, or under any other agreement.

9.7 ACCEPTANCE METHODS

9.7.1 Acceptance of this license occurs only when a person or
      entity performs an active action that is clearly,
      conspicuously, and unambiguously presented as acceptance
      of THIS license (the Proprietary Source-Visible License,
      Version 1.0). Qualifying actions include:
      (a) cloning this Repository;
      (b) forking this Repository;
      (c) downloading any files from this Repository with intent
      to use, modify, or evaluate the Software;
      (d) deploying or executing this Software;
      (e) submitting a Pull Request or Contribution;
      (f) checking, clicking, or otherwise activating a
      dedicated acceptance control (such as a checkbox or
      button) that is labeled in a manner specifically and
      unambiguously identifying this license — for example,
      "I agree to the Proprietary Source-Visible License",
      "I accept the PSVL terms", or substantially similar
      wording that names or directly references this license;
      (g) typing or entering "I agree", "I accept", or
      substantially similar wording into a text field
      specifically and unambiguously presented as acceptance
      of this license;
      (h) clicking through an interstitial page that
      conspicuously displays this license and requires
      affirmative acknowledgment to proceed.

       Generic buttons or phrases such as "OK", "Yes",
       "Continue", "Got it", "Proceed", or "Submit" do NOT
       constitute acceptance unless the surrounding interface
       clearly, conspicuously, and unambiguously presents the
       action as acceptance of this license. Scanning a QR code,
       solving a CAPTCHA, or dismissing a notification does NOT,
       by itself, constitute acceptance.

9.7.2 Merely viewing, reading, or browsing this source code on
      a public hosting platform does NOT constitute acceptance
      of this license.

9.7.3 Acceptance by any of the methods listed in 9.7.1 shall
      have the same legal force and effect as a handwritten
      signature.

9.7.4 The Author does not consent to access, processing,
      copying, indexing, ingestion, or training by Automated
      Systems or AI Systems (as defined in Section 1), and
      reserves all rights against such use under applicable
      copyright, contract, database, and trade-secret law,
      subject to the limited exception in Section 2.5 for
